Library for the Grove Sound Recorder Module
Created by Wendell Capili, August 29, 2011.

adapted from Seeedstudio's sample code:
http://garden.seeedstudio.com/index.php?title=Twig_-_Sound_Recorder_v0.92b

NOTE: 
1. We cannot use pin7 because the lib uses direct port manipulation and pin7 and 8 are on different pin groups 
2. Also, we cannot also use pins 0 and 1 for good measure because they are the RX and TX serial pins.
3. We cannot also use pin13 as it is short of sel2 pin
